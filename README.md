# BDRthermostatHA [deprecated]

## README !!!!
Please note that due to API changes and De Dietrich's transition towards new Smart app, this integration is not working anymore or only with very limited functionality.
I keep this repository public so anyone can follow up on my work in the future.


BDR (Baxi, De Dietrich, ~~Remeha~~) thermostat custom integration for Home Assistant

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

This component provides custom integration with BDR Thermea branded thermostats. It was tested with Smart TC app and De Dietrich devices. **It does not work (or only limited functionalities) with Remeha eTwist App due to API differences and constant API changes**. 

## How to install
You can use HACS to install this integration as custom repository

If you are not using HACS, you must copy `bdr_thermostat` into your `custom_components` folder on HA

## Configuration
Configuration via integration is recommended. Add an instance of `BDR Thermostat` using the UI:

And follow the steps:

Pairing code can be get from the thermostat device or from the Smart TC app.

## Screenshot
Integration will create a climate entity and several sensor entities. It will look like this in Lovelace dashboard:

I used following YAML code for the dashboard card:
```yaml
square: false
columns: 1
type: grid
cards:
  - cards:
      - entity: climate.bdr_thermostat
        type: thermostat
        name: Termostat
      - type: entities
        entities:
          - entity: sensor.bdr_thermostat_outside_temperature
            name: Venkovn√≠ teplota
          - entity: sensor.bdr_thermostat_status
            name: Stav
          - entity: sensor.bdr_thermostat_water_pressure
            name: Tlak vody
          - entity: sensor.bdr_thermostat_water_temperature
            name: Teplota vody
          - entity: sensor.bdr_thermostat_errors
            name: Chyby
        state_color: true
    type: vertical-stack
```
